			<legend><h1>Programming language</h1></legend>
			<p class="span"><span>A</span> programming language is a formal system designed to instruct a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. It serves as an intermediary between human-readable code and machine-executable instructions. Programming languages allow developers to write and communicate algorithms and logic to a computer, enabling the creation of software applications, scripts, and other computational solutions.</p><br>
			<p class="key">Key components and characteristics of programming languages include:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Syntax:</b>&ensp;The set of rules that define the combinations of symbols and keywords that form valid statements in the language. Syntax determines how programmers structure their code.</li>
				<li><b>Semantics:</b>&ensp;The meaning associated with the combinations of symbols and keywords. Semantics define the intended behavior of the code and how different instructions should be interpreted and executed.</li>
				<li><b>Variables and Data Types:</b>&ensp;Programming languages provide ways to declare and use variables, as well as define different types of data such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, and more.</li>
				<li><b>Control Structures: </b>&ensp;Mechanisms for controlling the flow of execution in a program. This includes conditional statements (if-else), loops (for, while), and branching constructs.</li>
				<li><b>Functions and Procedures:</b>&ensp;Modular units of code that can be defined and called to perform specific tasks. Functions promote code reusability and maintainability.</li>
				<li><b>Input/Output:</b>&ensp;Facilities for interacting with the external environment, such as reading from and writing to files, receiving input from users, and displaying output.</li>
				<li><b>Libraries and Frameworks:</b>&ensp;Collections of pre-written code and tools that developers can use to simplify common tasks and accelerate the development process.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>Programming languages can be categorized into different types based on their use cases, paradigms, and design philosophies. Common programming languages include C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and many others, each with its own strengths and weaknesses depending on the context of use.</p><br><br>

			<legend><h1>Web Development</h1><br></legend>
			<p>Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications, typically for the internet or an intranet. It involves a combination of various skills and disciplines to produce a functional, visually appealing, and interactive online experience. Web development encompasses both the front-end (client-side) and back-end (server-side) aspects of a website or web application.</p><br>
			<p class="key">Key components of web development include:</p><br>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Front-End Development:&ensp;</b>This involves building the user interface and user experience that users interact with directly. Front-end developers use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the structure, style, and interactivity of web pages.</li>
				<li><b>Back-End Development:&ensp;</b>The back-end is responsible for server-side logic, databases, and application functionality. Back-end developers work with server-side scripting languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, PHP) and databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) to handle data processing, storage, and retrieval.</li>
				<li><b>Full-Stack Development:&ensp;</b>Full-stack developers have expertise in both front-end and back-end development, allowing them to work on all aspects of a web project. They can handle the entire development process, from designing the user interface to managing server-side logic and databases.</li>
				<li><b>Web Design:&ensp;</b>While often considered a separate discipline, web design is an integral part of web development. Web designers focus on creating visually appealing layouts, graphics, and overall aesthetics to enhance the user experience.</li>
				<li><b>Web Accessibility:&ensp;</b>Web developers also consider accessibility, ensuring that websites and applications are usable by people with disabilities. This involves adhering to standards and practices that make content accessible to a wide range of users.</li>
				<li><b>Web Security:&ensp;</b> Security is a crucial aspect of web development. Developers implement measures to protect websites from common vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other potential threats.</li>
				<li><b>Content Management Systems (CMS):&ensp;</b> Web developers may work with CMS platforms (e.g., WordPress, Drupal) to simplify the process of content creation and management, especially for websites with frequent updates.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>Web development can be categorized into different roles, including front-end developers, back-end developers, full-stack developers, and specialized roles like UI/UX designers and web security experts. The field is dynamic, with ongoing advancements in technologies, frameworks, and best practices to keep up with the evolving landscape of the internet.</p><br><br>
